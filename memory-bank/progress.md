✅ **Message Formatting**: Support for Markdown and HTML formatting
✅ **Dialog Listing**: Retrieve list of available chats/dialogs
✅ **Link Generation**: Create direct links to specific messages
✅ **Direct Message Retrieval**: Read specific messages by IDs in any chat
✅ **MTProto Access**: Invoke arbitrary MTProto methods
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and propagation
✅ **Session Management**: Proper Telegram session handling and authentication
✅ **Contact Resolution**: Advanced contact search using Telegram's native API
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive tool documentation with usage examples
✅ **Code Quality**: Clean codebase with DRY principles applied and unused code removed

## What's Left to Build
**Status**: All core requirements have been implemented and tested successfully.

**Future Considerations**:
- Monitor for new user needs or Telegram API changes
- Potential performance optimizations based on usage patterns
- Additional features based on user feedback

## Current Status

### Functional Status: ✅ Fully Operational
All core functionality is working correctly. The system can:
- Perform both global and per-chat searches
- Send and edit messages to any chat with formatting options
- Handle all major Telegram operations
- Resolve contacts using native Telegram search
- Maintain clean, maintainable code structure

### Documentation Status: ✅ Comprehensive and Complete
All documentation has been enhanced with:
- Clear distinction between search modes with examples
- Comprehensive guidance on parameter usage
- Usage examples for different scenarios
- Message formatting documentation
- Contact resolution workflows
- Read-by-ID workflow and examples

### Code Quality Status: ✅ Clean and Maintainable
- **DRY Principles**: Applied throughout the codebase
- **Shared Utilities**: Common functionality extracted to utils modules
- **Unused Code Removal**: Monitoring and statistics functionality removed
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized error handling and logging

### Issue Resolution Status: ✅ All Resolved
- **Search Query Interpretation**: Resolved with improved documentation and contact resolution tools
- **Documentation Clarity**: Resolved with comprehensive examples and guidance
- **Message Formatting Support**: Resolved with parse_mode parameter
- **DRY Refactor**: Comprehensive refactoring applied to messages module with shared utilities for logging, error handling, and result building
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused monitoring and statistics functionality

## Known Issues
**Status**: No known issues. All previously identified problems have been resolved.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Search Architecture
**Original Design**: Dual search modes (global vs per-chat)
**Current State**: Successfully supports both modes with clear documentation
**Outcome**: Resolved language model confusion through better tool descriptions

### Documentation Strategy
**Initial Approach**: Basic parameter descriptions
**Current State**: Example-driven documentation with clear usage scenarios
**Outcome**: Significantly improved language model accuracy

### Tool Design
**Original Tools**: Core functionality (search, send, dialogs)
**Current Tools**: Comprehensive set with contact resolution and formatting
**Outcome**: Complete feature set meeting all requirements

### Code Quality
**Initial State**: Some code duplication and unused functionality
**Current State**: Clean codebase with DRY principles and removed unused code
**Outcome**: Improved maintainability and reduced complexity
