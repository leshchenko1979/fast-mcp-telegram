## What Works (Functional Status)

### Core Functionality ✅
- **MCP Server**: FastMCP-based server with full Telegram integration
- **Message Search**: Global and per-chat search with multi-query support
- **Message Operations**: Send, edit, read messages with formatting support
- **Contact Management**: Search and get contact details
- **Phone Messaging**: Send messages to phone numbers not in contacts
- **MTProto Access**: Raw method invocation capability
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and error handling

### Advanced Features ✅
- **Multi-Query Search**: Comma-separated terms with parallel execution and deduplication
- **LLM-Optimized Media**: Lightweight placeholders instead of raw Telethon objects
- **Structured Logging**: Loguru integration with stdlib bridge and emitter tracking
- **Logging Spam Reduction**: Module-level filtering reduces Telethon noise by 99%

### Deployment & Integration ✅
- **HTTP Transport**: FastMCP over HTTP with CORS support
- **Cursor Integration**: Verified working with Cursor IDE
- **Production Deployment**: VDS deployment with Traefik and TLS
- **Environment Management**: Proper credential handling and session management

## What's Left to Build (Remaining Work)

### Potential Enhancements
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent rate limiting for API calls
- **Caching**: Add message and contact caching for performance
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search filters and operators
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk message operations and batch processing
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time message notifications via webhooks

### Infrastructure Improvements
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced metrics and health checks
- **Security**: Additional authentication and authorization layers
- **Documentation**: API documentation and usage examples
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite and integration tests

## Known Issues and Status

### Resolved Issues ✅
- **Logging Spam**: Fixed with module-level filtering (reduced from 9,000+ to ~16 lines per session)
- **Media Serialization**: Resolved with LLM-optimized placeholders
- **Multi-Query Format**: Simplified from JSON arrays to comma-separated strings
- **Connection Reliability**: Improved with automatic reconnection logic
- **Phone Messaging**: Added capability to send messages to phone numbers not in contacts

### Current Limitations
- **Rate Limits**: Subject to Telegram API rate limiting
- **Search Scope**: Global search has different capabilities than per-chat search
- **Session Management**: Requires proper session handling and authentication

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Logging Strategy Evolution
1. **Initial**: Basic logging with standard library
2. **Enhanced**: Added Loguru with stdlib bridge for better formatting
3. **Spam Issue**: Telethon DEBUG logging produced excessive noise (9,000+ messages)
4. **String Filtering**: Attempted message-based filtering (complex and fragile)
5. **Module Filtering**: Implemented module-level log level control (clean and effective)

### Search Implementation Evolution
1. **Basic**: Single query search only
2. **Multi-Query**: Added JSON array support for multiple terms
3. **Simplified**: Changed to comma-separated string format for better LLM compatibility
4. **Optimized**: Added parallel execution and deduplication

### Media Handling Evolution
1. **Raw Objects**: Initially returned raw Telethon media objects
2. **Serialization Issues**: Discovered LLM incompatibility with binary data
3. **Placeholders**: Implemented lightweight metadata-only placeholders
4. **Optimized**: Preserved essential information while eliminating bloat
