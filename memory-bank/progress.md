## What's Left to Build
**Status**: All core requirements have been implemented and tested successfully.

**Future Considerations**:
- Monitor for new user needs or Telegram API changes
- Potential performance optimizations based on usage patterns
- Additional features based on user feedback

## Current Status

### Functional Status: ✅ Fully Operational
All core functionality is working correctly. The system can:
- Perform both global and per-chat searches
- Execute multi-query searches with comma-separated terms
- Send and edit messages to any chat with formatting options
- Handle all major Telegram operations
- Resolve contacts using native Telegram search
- Return LLM-optimized media placeholders instead of raw Telethon objects
- Maintain clean, maintainable code structure

### Documentation Status: ✅ Comprehensive and Complete
All documentation has been enhanced with:
- Clear distinction between search modes with examples
- Multi-query search examples with comma-separated terms
- Comprehensive guidance on parameter usage
- Usage examples for different scenarios
- Message formatting documentation
- Contact resolution workflows
- Read-by-ID workflow and examples
- LLM-optimized media placeholder documentation

### Code Quality Status: ✅ Clean and Maintainable
- **DRY Principles**: Applied throughout the codebase
- **Shared Utilities**: Common functionality extracted to utils modules
- **Unused Code Removal**: Monitoring and statistics functionality removed
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized error handling and logging
- **Multi-Query Support**: Parallel execution with deduplication

### Issue Resolution Status: ✅ All Resolved
- **Search Query Interpretation**: Resolved with improved documentation and contact resolution tools
- **Documentation Clarity**: Resolved with comprehensive examples and guidance
- **Message Formatting Support**: Resolved with parse_mode parameter
- **DRY Refactor**: Comprehensive refactoring applied to messages module with shared utilities for logging, error handling, and result building
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused monitoring and statistics functionality
- **Multi-Query Search**: Successfully implemented with comma-separated terms and parallel execution

## Known Issues
**Status**: No known issues. All previously identified problems have been resolved.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Search Architecture
**Original Design**: Dual search modes (global vs per-chat)
**Current State**: Successfully supports both modes with multi-query capability
**Outcome**: Resolved language model confusion through better tool descriptions and enhanced search functionality

### Multi-Query Implementation
**Initial Request**: User wanted multiple queries with deduplicated results
**Implementation**: Comma-separated string format with parallel execution
**Outcome**: Enhanced search efficiency and user experience

### Documentation Strategy
**Initial Approach**: Basic parameter descriptions
**Current State**: Example-driven documentation with clear usage scenarios and multi-query examples
**Outcome**: Significantly improved language model accuracy

### Tool Design
**Original Tools**: Core functionality (search, send, dialogs)
**Current Tools**: Comprehensive set with contact resolution, formatting, and multi-query search
**Outcome**: Complete feature set meeting all requirements

### Code Quality
**Initial State**: Some code duplication and unused functionality
**Current State**: Clean codebase with DRY principles, removed unused code, and enhanced search capabilities
**Outcome**: Improved maintainability and reduced complexity

## Project Health: ✅ Excellent
The project has successfully achieved all defined goals and is production-ready with comprehensive documentation, testing, and clean code structure. Multi-query search functionality enhances the user experience significantly.

## Repository Maintenance

- (2025-08-25) Repository renamed to `fast-mcp-telegram` and Git remote updated. Documentation (`README.md`) and packaging metadata (`setup.py`) now reference the new repository URL and directory name.
- (2025-08-26) Multi-query search functionality implemented with comma-separated terms and parallel execution
 
## Deployment Status

- (2025-08-26) Deployed to VDS with Traefik on `https://tg-mcp.redevest.ru/mcp`. Healthchecks green, Cursor connects when URL includes `/mcp`. Session mounted via bind `./mcp_telegram.session:/data/mcp_telegram.session`. Logging expanded to DEBUG with bridging of stdlib loggers to Loguru.
