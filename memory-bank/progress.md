## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Logging Strategy Evolution
1. **Initial**: Basic logging with standard library
2. **Enhanced**: Added Loguru with stdlib bridge for better formatting
3. **Spam Issue**: Telethon DEBUG logging produced excessive noise (9,000+ messages)
4. **String Filtering**: Attempted message-based filtering (complex and fragile)
5. **Module Filtering**: Implemented module-level log level control (clean and effective)

### Search Implementation Evolution
1. **Basic**: Single query search only
2. **Multi-Query**: Added JSON array support for multiple terms
3. **Simplified**: Changed to comma-separated string format for better LLM compatibility
4. **Optimized**: Added parallel execution and deduplication

### Dependency Management Evolution
1. **pip + requirements.txt**: Initial setup with pip and requirements file
2. **UV Migration**: Migrated to uv for faster installs and better caching
3. **Multi-stage Docker**: Implemented uv-based multi-stage builds for optimized images
4. **Locked Dependencies**: uv.lock provides reproducible builds and faster deployments

### Media Handling Evolution
1. **Raw Objects**: Initially returned raw Telethon media objects
2. **Serialization Issues**: Discovered LLM incompatibility with binary data
3. **Placeholders**: Implemented lightweight metadata-only placeholders
4. **Optimized**: Preserved essential information while eliminating bloat

### Error Handling Evolution
1. **Initial**: Mixed error handling - some tools raised exceptions, others returned None
2. **Inconsistent**: get_contact_details returned None, search_messages raised exceptions
3. **Partial Fix**: get_contact_details updated to return structured errors
4. **Unified Pattern**: All tools now return structured error responses with consistent format
5. **Server Integration**: server.py detects and handles error responses appropriately
