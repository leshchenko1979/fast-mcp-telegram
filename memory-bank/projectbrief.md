# Project Brief: tg_mcp

## Project Overview
tg_mcp is a Python-based MCP (Modular Control Platform) server that provides comprehensive Telegram integration capabilities. The project enables AI assistants and language models to interact with Telegram through a standardized interface, offering search, messaging, and analytics functionality.

## Core Requirements
1. **Telegram Integration**: Connect to Telegram via MTProto API using Telethon
2. **Search Functionality**: Global and per-chat message search with filtering capabilities
3. **Messaging**: Send messages to chats with reply functionality
4. **Analytics**: Generate statistics and insights from chat data
5. **MCP Compliance**: Follow MCP protocol standards for tool integration

## Key Goals
- Provide reliable Telegram access for AI assistants
- Enable efficient message search and retrieval
- Support comprehensive chat management and analytics
- Maintain clean separation between global and targeted search operations
- Ensure proper documentation for language model usage



## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing Telegram API limitations
- Need to handle both global and per-chat search scenarios
- Must provide clear documentation for AI model usage patterns
- Should maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations
