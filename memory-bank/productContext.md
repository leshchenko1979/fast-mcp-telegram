## Why This Project Exists
The fast-mcp-telegram project addresses the need for AI assistants and language models to interact with Telegram in a structured, reliable manner. Traditional approaches require complex API integrations and authentication handling, while this MCP server provides a standardized interface that abstracts away these complexities.

## Problems It Solves
1. **AI-Telegram Integration Gap**: Bridges the divide between AI assistants and Telegram's messaging platform
2. **Search Complexity**: Simplifies message search across multiple chats and channels
3. **Data Access**: Provides structured access to Telegram data for analysis and automation
4. **Authentication Management**: Handles Telegram session management and API authentication
5. **Standardization**: Offers a consistent interface for different AI platforms

## How It Should Work
### For Language Models
1. **Search Operations**: Models should use `chat_id` parameter to target specific contacts/chats
2. **Global Search**: Only for finding messages across all chats, not for targeting specific contacts
3. **Clear Intent**: Models must distinguish between "search in this person's chat" vs "search for this term globally"

### User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Usage**: AI models should naturally understand when to use chat_id vs global search
- **Accurate Results**: Search should return relevant messages from the intended source
- **Efficient Queries**: Minimize unnecessary global searches when specific chat targeting is possible
- **Clear Documentation**: Provide explicit guidance for different search scenarios

### Browser Setup Experience
- **Single Entry Point**: Users open `/setup` to authenticate via web
- **Guided Flow**: Phone → Code/2FA → Immediate config generation and download
- **No Dead Ends**: Sessions remain open until setup completes to avoid restarts
- **Copy/Download**: JSON shown and downloadable as `mcp.json`; copy button provided



## Target User Experience
1. **Contact-Specific Search**: "Find messages from John" → Use chat_id with John's chat ID
2. **Content Search**: "Find messages about project X" → Use global search with query "project X"
3. **Hybrid Search**: "Find messages about project X from John" → Use chat_id + query combination
