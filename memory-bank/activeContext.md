## Current Work Focus
**Primary**: Applied DRY principles to connection management by creating `get_connected_client()` function that combines `get_client()` and `ensure_connection()`. This eliminates repetitive connection check patterns across all tools while maintaining the same reliability.

**Current Status**: System is production-ready with comprehensive documentation and testing. All major features are complete and working with improved code maintainability, clean logging, single-source error handling, and minimal code. The codebase now includes robust connection management with DRY principles applied. The standalone `generate_links` MCP tool was removed; links remain included in all message results.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### DRY Connection Management
**Decision**: Created `get_connected_client()` function to eliminate repetitive connection check patterns
**Rationale**: All tools were using the same pattern of `get_client()` followed by `ensure_connection()` checks
**Impact**: Cleaner, more maintainable code with reduced duplication while maintaining the same reliability

### Connection Management Fix
**Decision**: Added `ensure_connection()` checks to all client operations
**Rationale**: The "Can't send while disconnected" error occurs when the Telegram client loses connection and operations are attempted without reconnecting
**Impact**: All tools now automatically reconnect if disconnected, preventing operation failures

### Code Quality Improvements
**Decision**: Applied connection checks consistently across all tools
**Rationale**: Ensures reliable operation regardless of network conditions or connection state
**Impact**: Improved reliability and user experience

### Documentation Maintenance
**Decision**: Keep documentation updated as new usage patterns emerge
**Rationale**: Language models may discover new edge cases or usage scenarios
**Impact**: Ensures continued accuracy of search and messaging functionality

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Connection Management Patterns
1. **Single Function Pattern**: Use `get_connected_client()` instead of separate `get_client()` + `ensure_connection()` calls
2. **Automatic Reconnection**: All tools now check connection state before operations
3. **Graceful Error Handling**: Clear error messages when connection cannot be established
4. **Consistent Implementation**: Connection checks added to all client-using functions

### Search Usage Patterns
1. **Contact-Specific Search**: Use `chat_id` parameter, `query` can be empty or specific
2. **Content Search**: Use global search with `query` parameter, no `chat_id`
3. **Hybrid Search**: Use both `chat_id` and `query` for targeted content search
4. **Exact Message Retrieval**: Use `read_messages(chat_id, message_ids)` when IDs are known

### Message Formatting Patterns
1. **Plain Text**: Default behavior (`parse_mode=None`) for maximum compatibility
2. **Markdown**: Use `parse_mode='md'` or `'markdown'` for rich text formatting
3. **HTML**: Use `parse_mode='html'` for HTML-based formatting

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Test Connection Resilience**: Verify that the connection fixes work under various network conditions
2. **Monitor System Performance**: Track usage patterns and identify any remaining issues
3. **Gather User Feedback**: Collect feedback on connection reliability and message sending
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update docs if new usage patterns emerge
5. **Maintenance**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for API changes
