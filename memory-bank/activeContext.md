## Current Work Focus
**Primary**: Web setup interface improvements and 2FA authentication flow completion (2025-09-09)

**Current Status**: Successfully enhanced the web setup interface with improved styling and fixed the missing 2FA authentication route. The complete authentication flow now works properly for users with 2FA enabled.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Web Setup Interface Improvements (2025-09-09)
**Decision**: Enhanced web setup interface styling and user experience
**Changes Made**:
- **Input Text Size**: Increased to 1.1rem for better readability
- **Button Text Size**: Increased to 1rem for better prominence  
- **Hint Text Size**: Reduced to 0.85rem for more subtle appearance
- **Removed Excessive Text**: Eliminated redundant "Enter your phone to receive a code" instruction
- **Cleaner Layout**: Removed empty card styling from step div for cleaner appearance
**Impact**: Better visual hierarchy with larger interactive elements and smaller instructional text

### 2FA Authentication Route Fix (2025-09-09)
**Decision**: Added missing `/setup/2fa` route to complete the authentication flow
**Problem**: 2FA form was submitting to non-existent endpoint, causing 404 errors
**Solution**: 
- Added `@mcp_app.custom_route("/setup/2fa", methods=["POST"])` handler
- Implemented proper 2FA password validation with `client.sign_in(password=password)`
- Added error handling for invalid passwords and authentication failures
- Integrated with existing session management and config generation flow
**Impact**: Complete authentication flow now works for users with 2FA enabled

### Web Setup Flow Architecture (2025-09-09)
**Current Flow**: `/setup` → `/setup/phone` → `/setup/verify` → `/setup/2fa` (if needed) → config generation
**Implementation**:
- HTMX-based dynamic form updates with `hx-target="#step"`
- Session management with TTL-based cleanup (900s default)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic config generation and download capability
**Impact**: Seamless browser-based authentication experience

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Web Interface Styling Patterns
1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Larger interactive elements (inputs, buttons) with smaller instructional text
2. **Clean Layout**: Minimal text, clear form structure, no empty visual elements
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with proper spacing and sizing
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with context-specific guidance

### Authentication Flow Patterns
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only necessary information at each step
2. **Session Persistence**: Maintain setup sessions throughout the flow
3. **Error Recovery**: Allow retry with clear error messages
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: TTL-based session cleanup prevents resource leaks

### VDS Testing and Diagnosis Methodology
1. **Environment Access**: SSH with credentials from `.env` file (`VDS_USER`, `VDS_HOST`, `VDS_PROJECT_PATH`)
2. **Deployment Process**: Use `./scripts/deploy-mcp.sh` for automated deployment with session management
3. **Container Management**: Use `docker compose` commands for container status, logs, and health checks
4. **Authentication Testing**: Use `curl` with proper MCP protocol headers and bearer tokens
5. **Log Analysis**: Monitor server logs for authentication flow and error patterns
6. **Session File Management**: Check `~/.config/fast-mcp-telegram/` for token-specific session files
7. **Traefik Integration**: Domain routing, SSL certificate management
8. **Health Monitoring**: Container health checks and endpoint monitoring
9. **Debugging Approach**: Systematic issue elimination through targeted testing
