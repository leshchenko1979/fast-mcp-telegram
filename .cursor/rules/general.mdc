You are running in Cursor IDE. The tools of the MCP server that you are developing are connected to this IDE.
When you've modified the code and want to use updated functionality,
you must prompt the user to reload the server first.

All comments, docstrings, and documentation must be in English only. Do not use any other non-English language in code comments, docstrings, or documentation.

Always use the DRY principle.

Always check today's date with shell command `date` when inserting current date.
